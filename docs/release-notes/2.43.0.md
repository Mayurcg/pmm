Percona Monitoring and Management (PMM) is an open source database monitoring, management, and observability solution for MySQL, PostgreSQL, and MongoDB.

It enables you to observe the health of your database systems, explore new patterns in their behavior, troubleshoot them and execute database management operations regardless of whether your databases are located on-premises or in the cloud.

## Release highlights


### Official ARM support for PMM Client

As ARM adoption grows in data centers and cloud environments, we are excited to announce official support for ARM architecture in PMM Clients. Starting with PMM 2.43, we provide pre-built binaries for ARM architecture so that you can seamlessly monitor ARM-based infrastructure, including popular cloud instances and emerging ARM-powered servers.

All PMM Client features, including `node_exporter` and `mysqld_exporter`, are fully supported and optimized for ARM platforms. 

ARM-based PMM Clients easily integrate with existing PMM Server installations, enabling unified monitoring across both x86 and ARM architectures.

#### Upgrading and getting started

If you have been  compiling PMM on ARM manually, you can now upgrade to the official release. You will also find ARM-specific instructions in the [installation guide](../setting)

### Repository changes for PMM: Transition to dedicated `pmm2-client` repository

Effective July 1, 2024, Percona has discontinued updates for the original Percona (https://repo.percona.com/percona/) and tools (https://repo.percona.com/tools/) repositories in favor of dedicated product repositories. This change streamlines our repository management and improves efficiency across our product ecosystem.

For PMM users, this means you can now access the most up-to-date and secure versions of PMM exclusively from the dedicated `pmm2-client` repository. To facilitate a smooth transition to this new repo, we have developed an automated script that:

1. Checks installed packages and their repositories
2. Identifies PMM-related packages that should be installed from the `pmm2-client` repository
3. Provides instructions for enabling the correct repository

To ensure your PMM installation remains secure and up-to-date, [download this script from GitHub](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Percona-Lab/release-aux/main/scripts/check_percona_packages.py) and run it on your system.

For detailed instructions and more information about this change, check out [our recent blog post](https://www.percona.com/blog/ensure-the-correct-repositories-are-enabled-for-percona-packages/) and [updated documentation]().


## Improvements

- [PMM-13133](https://perconadev.atlassian.net/browse/PMM-13133) - 

- [PMM-13054](https://perconadev.atlassian.net/browse/PMM-13054) - The default number of log lines for each log file returned by `httsp://<pmm-server>/logs.zip` endpoint has been increased from 1,000 to 50,000. 

Additionally, the endpoint now includes a customizable line-count parameter in the download URL, allowing you to specify a custom number of log lines or opt for unlimited log size. For more information, see the [API documentation](https://percona-pmm.readme.io/reference/logs).


## Maintenance

### QAN update: Upgrade to `pg_query_go` v5 and impact on PostgreSQL 9.x

As part of our ongoing maintenance efforts, we have upgraded the `pg_query_go` package to version 5. This latest version helps parse PostgreSQL queries in QAN, provides improved functionality, and enables subsequent upgrades of important dependencies.

However, with this change, QAN will no longer be able to list PostgreSQL database tables for versions 9.4, 9.5, and 9.6. Since all PostgreSQL 9.x versions have already reached their end-of-life status, we recommend upgrading to a supported version of PostgreSQL.

If you're looking to upgrade, you can easily [install the latest version of Percona Distribution for PostgreSQL](https://docs.percona.com/postgresql/16/installing.html).
